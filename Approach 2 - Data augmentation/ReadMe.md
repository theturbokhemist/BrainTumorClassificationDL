This folder includes the Jupyter Notebook and checkpoints to train our model using approach 2 - Data augmentation.

Since the dataset is too large, you can find it at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QP37SghtwW-xcQ0a62-tx7sf3W2fIi1w/view?usp=share_link

Please modify the paths to the directory in the Jupyter Notebook file so that you can train properly.
